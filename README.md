[Our team was formed by friends who are interested in the media industry and technology. It all started when some our team members felt like victims from knowing that the articles theyâ€™ve read from well known social media apps were fake news, but they scoured the internet to see if there was an easy solution to stop falling into this manipulation.  There were none. So we dreamt to solve it together to end this manipulation once and for all. We are determined in making a better society and we believe that removing fake news in the social media field can help achieve that.](https://www.media2check.com/)https://www.media2check.com/
