# Filter fake news out by Media2Check #

Fake news articles that are intentionally false designed to manipulate has been used to influence politics and promote advertising. Stories that are untrue and that intentionally mislead readers have caused growing mistrust among American people. In a few cases, this mistrust results in incivility, protest over imaginary events, or violence. People, organizations, and governments use fake news for a couple of different reasons. They intensify social conflict to undermine people’s faith in the democratic process and people’s ability to work together.

New York Times wrote an article to expose these fakes news posts shared on an SNS platform. Other text based SNS platforms showed similar trend of sharing false information.

## Team work ##
Our team was formed by friends who are interested in the media industry and technology. It all started when some our team members felt like victims from knowing that the articles they’ve read from well known social media apps were fake news, but they scoured the internet to see if there was an easy solution to stop falling into this manipulation. 

We used [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) to collaborate on program architecture. Each members thought of ways to filter fake news using the information available to public. Then we thought of case when SNS platforms provide access to private information.

Reviewing all posts upload on SNS platforms is intensive work so we chose to review posts that are trending. Facebook does not provide API to public so we worked on twitter
